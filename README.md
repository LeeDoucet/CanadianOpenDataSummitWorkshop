# Welcome to the Data on a Dime Workshop 

Presenter - Lee Doucet

The democratization of information through Open Data has been a boon to researchers, educators, students, businesses, and many others performing citizen science. In an effort to aid those working with Open Data - we are going to walk participants through a quick data project and teach a few tricks to add to their toolbox. By the end of the workshop, beginners will gain a better idea how a project runs and be able to communicate that process more effectively while those more advanced will be exposed to common open-source tools used in Open Data projects. The workshop will run in the style of rel8ed.toâ€™s Robot Training Academy, where students receive quick training, help with exercises, and a path to earn micro-certifications in Data Science.
