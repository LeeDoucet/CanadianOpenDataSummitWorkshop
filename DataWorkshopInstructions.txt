- - - Part 1: Getting Data - - - -


In your web browser, search for the Toronto Open Data portal 

Click through to the portal and access the search bar 

Type "Apartment Building"

Two data sets: Apartment Building Evaluation | Apartment Building Registration

Download them both



- - - Part 2: How to Merge Data - - - 


Step 1 | Worksheets 

Using your web browser, open up Google Sheets 

File > Import > Open Up Evaluation Apartment Building 

File > Import > Open up Apartment Building Registration (Click "insert new sheet")

[Ensure that both data sets are in the same workbook as separate sheets]


Step 2 | Merging Prep

On Apartment Building Registration find the column with RSN. Grab and drag it to the 
first column
[Column order should be RSN followed by ID]

Goto the Evaluation Apartment Building sheet and click on column C, down arrow, and 
then insert 1 left 


Step 3 | Formula's 

In the cell C2, paste the below formula 

=VLOOKUP(B2,'Apartment Building Registration Data'!$A$2:$BJ$3481,43,FALSE)

Copy it, then click on the column arrow and goto paste special > special formula only

You can now repeat this process. Create another blank column and paste this formula

=VLOOKUP(B2,'Apartment Building Registration Data'!$A$2:$BJ$3481,46,FALSE)

Change the column heads, PCODE for the 43 and Property Management for 46. 


Step 4 | Viola 

Save the data and download it to your computer [File > download]

It's a bit awkward at first but it's fairly easy to reproduce 

Try it on the practice files with Table_City | Area Table 



- - - - Part 3 Tableau Public - - - 


Step 1 | Sign-in and upload data 

Search for Tableau Public - Create an account - it's free and in the cloud

Upload your data 


Step 2 | Coordinates 

Drag Longitude into column and change it to Dimension

Drag Latitude to rows and change it to Dimension 
 
 
Step 3 | Change Values 

RSN > Change to number and dimension 
[Strings let you treat numbers like letters]
Year Evaluated > Change to String / Dimension

We now need to figure out the quality of all these buildings 

Step 4 | Year Evaluated & Results of Score 

You need to put filters on values, click on them and goto filter

Filter Year Evaluated to 2021 only
Filter Results of Score to Building Audit / 1 Year Building Audit only


Step 5 | Score & Colour

Add Score - change it to a dimension 
[Notice that it's hard to distinguish buildings apart visually]

Drop Results of Score into the color box 
Click on the color box and click edit color. Change Building Audit to red and 
Complete Evaluation in 1 year to yellow 


Step 6 | Last Details 

Put Site Address, PCODE, and Property Manager

Now you know where all the problematic buildings are in Toronto and all the details
If you live in one or are concerned, contact your local councillor.
